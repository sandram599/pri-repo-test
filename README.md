FINAL PROJECT
SE450 - OBJ-ORIENTED SOFTWARE DEV
JPaint Application - A 'paint' - like application that allows one to:
  - Select a shape
  - Select primary, secondary colors including shading types for the shapes
  - Click and draw the shapes on a canvas
  - Paste, delete, undo, redo, groups, and ungroups the shapes drawn on the canvas.

Developing the code for the project focuses on implementing the 5 SOLID princples to graps the concepts of the principles.
The features of the project are completed in Sprints, each lasting 2 weeks. 

Sprint 1: First features -
Drawn a filled-in Rectangle that displays after the mouse is released after clicking and dragging on the mouse.
Implement Undo/Redo for the shapes.

//the undo/redo methods code is written, but isn't working in the application. I attempted to pass in the commands in the
//clickhandler to implement Undo/Redo but it doesn't show on the canvas.
